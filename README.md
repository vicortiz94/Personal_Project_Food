# First Personal Project: Food Selector
## Introduction
This is a simple project I made to practice what I was learning. It helps you decide what to eat, from either a restuarant or a dish!
## Instalation 
Currently, the only way to use this program is to download it directly from github.
## How it works
This program works very simply, using list to order the items you have. There are two list, one for restuarants and one for dishes. You add items to the list, and then the program will recommend items based on what is in the front of the list. You can either choose that item, or you can skip it and go on to the next item. Once you have a selected an item, it'll pop it out of the list and put it towards the end. 
## Usage
The main way of connecting with the program would be to use the main.py file. From there, follow the prompts given to you in the console.
## Background
When I came back home from a two year religious mission, I had forgotten almost everything from my computer science courses. I wanted to not only relearn everything, but also create a project to apply what I was learning. I originally started this project around May of 2020, and finished roughly 3 months later. Although rough around the edges, I'm glad I was able to make something while learning python again
